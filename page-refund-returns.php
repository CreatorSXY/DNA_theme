      <h2>Return and Exchange Window</h2>
      <p>
        All return or exchange requests must be submitted within 30 days of delivery.
        The 30-day window begins on the date we send the "delivered" confirmation email,
        not the date the order was placed.
      </p>
      <p>Requests submitted after this period will not be accepted.</p>

      <div class="privacy-divider"></div>

      <h2>Condition Upon Arrival</h2>
      <p>
        For fragile items (such as mugs or other breakable goods), we purchase shipping insurance to ensure issues caused during transit can be properly resolved.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you believe an item was damaged before opening the package, please provide clear unboxing proof, including photos or video showing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the package in its original, sealed condition, and</li>
        <li>the item as it is being opened from the package.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This documentation allows us to work with the shipping carrier to determine whether the damage occurred during transit and to pursue an insurance claim when applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to resolve issues in cooperation with you, not in opposition.
        If you are able to help us confirm that damage occurred during shipping, we are better positioned to support a replacement or refund.
      </p>
